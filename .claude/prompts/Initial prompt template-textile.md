remove the template-designer completely.  I will start the   
  other way around.  Let's create a new feature called
  "template-textile".
  And let's make a complete implementation of fabric that is   
  compatible with the spirit of template-designer, but this    
  time fully based in a self-contained fabric module,
  according to the instructions in: .claude\implementations\T  
  EMPLATE-DESIGNER-FABRIC-IMPLEMENTATION.md
  1. Fabric is based on node-canvas:
  full source code at:
  D:\Projects\EPIC\tools-fabric-canvas-reference\node-canvas   
  2. Node-canvas readme is at: D:\Projects\EPIC\tools-fabric-  
  canvas-reference\node-canvas\Readme.md
  3. Fabric full sourcecode is at:
  D:\Projects\EPIC\tools-fabric-reference\fabric.js
  4. Fabric readme is at:
  D:\Projects\EPIC\tools-fabric-reference\fabric.js\README.md  
  Don't try to customize the integration too much, we'll work  
  on it later, just make sure the necessary main features      
  are provided.
  DON'T SCREW THE CURRENT VERSION OF NEXT.JS OF OUR
  APPLICATION, OR REACT, OR NODE.
