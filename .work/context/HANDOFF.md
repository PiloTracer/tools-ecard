# HANDOFF - session boundary

## Session status

**Closed:** 2026-07-16 — M4 Demo browser-only persistence + production restore-from-backup; public-Demo write barriers hardened (apiClient + Next BFF + api-server). Owner will use a clean Demo deploy with both Demo env flags.

**Updated:** 2026-07-16

Treat the next chat as a **new session**: do not assume unwritten goals from prior threads unless they appear in this file or linked artifacts.

**Repository state:** Thin-client Agent OS / UI OS / SOC. Master plan Approved; **M3 + M4 complete**. Demo mode + prd restore runbook + triple write barriers. Residual: Fabric render TODO, batch-import placeholders, U6 diagnostics docs.

**Recommended pick-up file:** `.work/plans/NEXT.md`

**Lost or new?** Read `.ai/START_HERE.md` (via `$AGENT_OS_SOURCE=/mnt/work/Projects/.ai`).

### UI layer (see `.work.ui/`)

- UI foundation: not started (`ui-foundation-complete: no`)
- NEXT_UI: `.work.ui/plans/NEXT_UI.md`
- Tokens: `front-cards/app/globals.css`

### SOC layer (see `.work.soc/`)

- Scaffold present; use `@session-soc` for security work.

## Fresh start - what the next session should do first

1. Run **`@session-control start`**.
2. Read **`.cursorrules`** (thin-client pointers + compose service names).
3. Read **P0 initial scope:** `.work/plans/foundation/*-01-*-initial-scope.md`.
4. Read **this file** through §Fresh start, then §Open owner actions.
5. Read `.work/plans/NEXT.md`.
6. For public Demo: confirm `DEMO_MODE=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` on a clean host (see operations runbook).

End with **`@session-control close`** (add `commit` / `commit push` only when requested).
